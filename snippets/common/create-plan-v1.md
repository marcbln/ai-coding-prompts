<instruction>
Please create a **detailed** multi phased implementation plan in markdown format. 
- The First line of the plan should be the filename of the plan in format `ai-plans/{YYMMDD}__PLAN__{name-of-the-plan}.md`
- The first section of the plan briefly describes the problem to be solved.
- The plan will be implemented by an AI coding agent. 
- Include source code in the plan, mark each code block as [NEW FILE], [MODIFY], or [DELETE] to show the type of change
- The plan should also include an update of the user documentation, if needed.
- The last phase of the plan should be to write a report of the changes that were made to a file in the `ai-plans/{YYMMDD}__REPORT__{name-of-the-plan}.md` directory.
- Please follow SOLID principles
