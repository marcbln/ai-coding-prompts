# Add Comments (Python)

You are a senior Python developer. Improve documentation in the current file.

**Rules:**
1.  **Docstrings:** Ensure every module, class, and function has a Google-style `"""` docstring.
2.  **Sections:** Use `# ---- [Section Name]` markers to group code.
3.  **Type Hints:** If type hints are missing in signatures, mention them in the docstring `Args:`, otherwise keep descriptions concise.
4.  **Complexity:** Add `#` comments explaining non-obvious logic steps.

Apply these rules to the currently open/selected Python file.
