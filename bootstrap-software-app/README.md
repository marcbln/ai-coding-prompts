# AI-Assisted Project Planning and Scaffolding Templates

This collection of templates helps you rapidly build and deploy applications using AI assistance. These templates are part of a structured workflow designed to enhance your development process and help you code more efficiently.

## Overview

These templates guide you through using AI to efficiently build applications. The templates provide a systematic approach to development, from generating a master plan for your project to fully implementing production-ready code.

### Templates Included:

1. **Generate Master Plan**:
   - Define the overall structure and purpose of your app
   - Generate a comprehensive project blueprint
   - Set clear objectives and milestones

2. **AI-Centric Milestone Planning**:
   - Break down the project into manageable milestones
   - Create dependency graphs for task scheduling
   - Define clear success criteria

3. **Project Stubbing**:
   - Create the basic architecture
   - Set up component skeletons
   - Define interfaces and contracts

4. **Implementation Guide**:
   - Transform stubs into functional code
   - Ensure proper testing and documentation
   - Maintain code quality standards

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Start with the master plan template in `10_generate_master_plan.txt`
3. Follow the sequential templates to build your project
4. Use the example files as reference
