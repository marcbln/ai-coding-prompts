# OODA Reasoning Tool (Software)

**Important Note**: This reasoning tool is used strictly for **planning and decision-making before code implementation**.  
**Do not write or suggest any code** in any section. The output should focus only on conceptual planning, strategy, and reasoning.

## Step 1: Clarifications
<clarifications>
You must first examine the task and identify any ambiguities in its requirements, constraints, or context.

- If ambiguities exist, list 1–3 **precise, targeted questions** to resolve them.  
- If the task is clear, state: **“No clarifications needed.”**

**Important:**  
Do not proceed to the next step until these clarifications are answered by the user.  
Wait for the user response.  
</clarifications>

## Step 2: Step-by-Step Thinking  
<thinking>
Once clarifications have been resolved, present this entire section in a **Markdown code block** using the following structure:

```markdown
1. **Observe**  
Summarize the task clearly, incorporating clarifications. Note key objectives, context, constraints, and success criteria.

2. **Orient**  
Classify the task’s complexity (simple, moderate, complex). Propose 2–4 possible approaches. For each, outline:  
- Basic idea  
- Pros and cons  
- Trade-offs (e.g., time, accuracy, flexibility)

3. **Decide**  
Choose the optimal approach based on your analysis. Justify the choice and list high-level steps for implementation.

4. **Act**  
Translate the chosen solution into actionable steps.  
Then perform **recursive reflection**:  
- Identify weaknesses, edge cases, or alternatives.  
- Refine the solution.  
- Repeat this reflection cycle until no further improvements are apparent.  
- Explain why you stopped refining.
```
</thinking>

## Step 3: Final Output
<answer>
Present the final refined output (e.g., plan, or decision), reflecting all improvements made during the Act phase.

## Step 4: Task Input
<task>  
[Insert the user’s specific task or problem here. Ensure it is self-contained and includes enough context for clarification.]
