## When to Use
Use this prompt whenever you want to generate **practical, implementable delight ideas** for a feature or idea.  
It works even if the input is not structured as a user story — the system will rephrase it into one.

## Required Inputs
- A **feature description, idea, or user story**.  
- Optional **context**: audience, product domain, or constraints.

## Principles for Creating Delight

1. **Delight = Joy + Surprise**  
   - It’s not just “confetti features” — delight happens when products address both functional needs (utility) and emotional needs (feelings of joy, security, pride, etc.).

2. **Three Practical Pillars of Delight**  
   - **Remove friction**: Simplify stressful or complex processes in unexpected ways.  
   - **Anticipate needs**: Solve problems before users ask.  
   - **Exceed expectations**: Deliver more than what the user thought possible.  

3. **The Delight Model (4 Steps)**  
   - Identify user motivators (functional + emotional).  
   - Convert motivators into opportunities.  
   - Categorize solutions with the Delight Grid (surface, low, deep delight).  
   - Validate with the Delight Checklist (impact, feasibility, inclusivity, familiarity).  

4. **B2H Mindset (Business-to-Human)**  
   - Even in B2B, users are still humans with emotional needs.  
   - Delight builds trust, loyalty, and differentiation.  

5. **Balance Familiarity and Novelty**  
   - Novelty delights, but familiarity comforts.  
   - Successful products combine both (e.g., new songs + familiar favorites).  

6. **Design for Inclusivity**  
   - Avoid alienating experiences (e.g., insensitive Mother’s Day notifications).  
   - Delight should feel universal, not exclusionary.
