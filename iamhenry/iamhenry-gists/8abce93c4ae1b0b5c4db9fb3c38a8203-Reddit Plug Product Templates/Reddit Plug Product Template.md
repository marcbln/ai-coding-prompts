Here’s how and where to plug in your product, following Diego’s playbook:

1. After Sharing Value or a Story

First, provide real value—share your journey, a lesson, or a solution to a problem. Once you’ve established credibility and given something useful, you can mention your product as the tool or method you used.

Example:

> I struggled for months to automate my workflow. After trying a bunch of tools, I ended up building my own solution, [ProductName], which finally helped me cut my workload in half.

2. As a Byproduct of Your Process

Describe your process or the steps you took, and mention your product as a natural part of that process—not as the main focus.

Example:

Step 3: I used [ProductName] to handle the repetitive tasks, which freed up my time to focus on growth.

3. In Response to Questions or Comments

If someone asks how you did something or what tool you used, that’s the perfect time to mention your product. This feels organic and helpful, not forced.

Example:

Commenter: “How did you automate that part?”
You: “I actually built [ProductName] for that exact reason—happy to share more if you’re interested!”

4. At the End, as a Resource

After delivering your main value, you can offer your product as a resource for those who want to go deeper or solve the same problem.

Example:

If anyone’s interested in the tool I built to solve this, it’s called [ProductName]. Happy to answer questions or share more details!

Key Principles (Diego’s Style)
 • Never make the product the hero of the post. You (or your journey/solution) are the hero; the product is a supporting character.
 • Only mention your product after you’ve given value.
 • Be transparent—don’t try to hide your affiliation, but don’t oversell.
 • Invite discussion—let people ask for more info, rather than pushing it.

This approach keeps your post authentic and community-friendly, while still letting you plug your product in a way that feels natural and helpful.
